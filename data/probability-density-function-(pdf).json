    "description": "Given a probability space \\((\\Omega, \\mathbb{P})\\), the PDF of a random variable \\(X\\) is the function whose value describes the probability of the random variable being each \\(\\omega\\in\\Omega\\) with \\(f(\\omega)=\\mathbb{P}(X=\\omega)\\). The following must hold for any PDF:\n\n$$\\int_{\\infty}^\\infty p(x)dx = 1$$\n\nNote that the PDF is describing how our random variable \\(X\\) is distributed over \\(\\Omega\\). In other words, PDFs describe probability distributions.",
