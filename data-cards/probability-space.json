    "description": "A probability space is a formal model that describes what an \"experiment\" with \"events\" is. In broad terms, it is the combination of a sample space $\\Omega$, a sigma algebra $\\sigma$, and a probability function $\\mathbb{P}$. We denote a probability space with the tuple $(\\Omega, \\sigma, \\mathbb{P})$ though we will often omit the sigma algebra for undergraduate probability theory. ",
