    "description": "Let $X$ be a $\\mathbb{R}^d$ Random variable defined on $(\\Omega, \\mathbb{P})$. The collection of numbers $\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\in\\Omega : X(\\omega)\\in A\\})$ for all $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$ is called the <b>distribution</b> of $X$ according to $\\mathbb{P}$.\n<br><br>\nThe probability distribution of random variable (in broad terms) tells us how likely a random variable is to take on certain values. For instance, a coin flip has a 50-50 chance to show heads or tails. ",
